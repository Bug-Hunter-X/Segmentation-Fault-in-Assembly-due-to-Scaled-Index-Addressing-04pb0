mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This instruction attempts to access memory using scaled index addressing.  If the calculation of `ebx+ecx*4` results in an address outside the allowed memory range, it will cause a segmentation fault or general protection fault. This is especially likely if `ecx` holds an unexpectedly large value or points to invalid memory.
